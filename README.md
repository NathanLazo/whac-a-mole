# Whac a mole

Whac-a-Mole is a classic arcade game where players use a mallet to hit moles as they pop up from holes in a playfield. Our implementation of the game is built using JavaScript and can be played in a web browser. The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty, a scoring system, and a time limit. The code is available on GitHub for anyone to use or modify.
